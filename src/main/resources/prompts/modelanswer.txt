(Please give extremely concise comments first commending the player for their correct guess, indicating which aspects they were right about, and
possibly which aspects they should have also considered. Mark against the model explanation below.)

Model explanation: The thief is the scholar. On the day of the crime, they accidentally knocked over the flask of hydrofluoric acid on the table,
which was next to the research notes (belonging to the lead scientist) they then stole. Hydrofluoric acid is very strong and burns through real leather. The scholar had gotten some on
their leather shoes, which they had to immediately take off. He hid it inside the very disused guest locker in hopes no one would find it, and
planned to retrieve it another time.

The scholar visits the science facility often, and lies about never having been in the particular lab room where the notes were stolen from.

Because they visit often, they would have the opportunity to plan the crime and know about the guest lockers that are around the facility.

Possible motive: sabotaging the lead scientist as they are competing for funding in academia.
