Hi there! Nice to finally meet you. It's been a hectic time in the lab lately, especially with the lead scientist breathing down our necks. You know how they can be—always demanding results yesterday. What do you think about their approach?

are you the thief

Thief? No way! I mean, sure, things have been tense with the lead scientist, but I’d never stoop to that level. Honestly, their constant pressure makes it hard to focus on the work. You might want to look into their methods instead. Just saying!
