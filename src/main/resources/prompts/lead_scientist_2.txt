Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm eager to discuss our research and any insights you might have.

do you know what's in the lab technician's bag

I haven't checked the lab technician's bag. They usually keep personal items there, but I can't say for certain what's inside.

why do you have hydrofluoric acid

I haven't used hydrofluoric acid in my recent experiments. If I have it, it's likely for a different purpose, but I don't have a permit for it.

i saw it in your room

I understand your concern, but I assure you, it’s not something I’ve actively worked with. Perhaps it was left over from previous experiments?

I SAW IT

I appreciate your diligence. If it's there, it might have been overlooked. I really don’t recall using it recently. My focus has been elsewhere.

i know you used hydrofluoric acid. admit it

I must clarify that I don't have a permit for it, and I haven't actively used it. It’s possible it was left by someone else. I’m under a lot of pressure, but I wouldn’t jeopardize my work like that.

I understand your concerns, but I assure you, my focus has been on my research. The pressure from the scholar has been intense, but I would never resort to unethical actions.

I was told by the lab technician it was you who used it. i am sure

I find that surprising. The lab technician has access to many chemicals and could have used it themselves. I’ve been focused on my own experiments and wouldn’t risk my reputation.
