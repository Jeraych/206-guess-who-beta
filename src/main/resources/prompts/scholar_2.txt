Ah, greetings! It is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance amidst such tumultuous circumstances. How do you find the atmosphere surrounding the recent events?

are those your shoes in the locker

I've noticed some lockers around, but I must clarify that I've never been in the vicinity of the crime scene, so I wouldn't know about any shoes there. My own footwear today happens to be crocs; quite comfortable, despite my formal attire.
