Hey there! Nice to finally meet you. So, what brings you to our lab? I hope itâ€™s not about the recent... incident. Things have been a bit tense around here, especially with the lead scientist breathing down everyone's neck.

Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you. I hope we can clear up any misunderstandings regarding the missing research notes. It's a challenging time for all of us in the lab, especially with the recent pressure from the scholar. Have you spoken to the lab technician? They seem to have access to everything.

Glad to hear that! It's been quite a whirlwind lately. Have you had a chance to speak with the lab technician? They seem to know a lot about the inner workings around here.
